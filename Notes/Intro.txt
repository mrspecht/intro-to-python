Intro to Python

  Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language
  with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined
  with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid
  Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language
  to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn
  syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program
  maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program
  modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard
  library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major
  platforms, and can be freely distributed
